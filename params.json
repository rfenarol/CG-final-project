She promoted a profound renewal of aesthetic values, and gave birth to a properly modern sensibility of everyday life. In this context, its specific contribution focuses on the spaces of the interior, which are conceived as an engine of a new way of living, which is still at the center of the contemporary lifestyle.\r\n![Paris, 1903-1999](/CG-final-project/images/2601681.JPG)\r\nIn the field of the history of the twentieth century, the advent of modernity is made possible by the enterprising boldness of this real reform of the interior. When she was only twenty-four, began a ten-year collaboration with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, at the famous atelier of 35, rue de SÃ¨vres in Paris.\r\nHer presence in the atelier of Le Corbusier is visible in all the furniture designed. Charlotte Perriand becomes a cornerstone of the renovation project promoted by the architect, notably by adding a dimension of humanity to the sometimes cold rationalism Le Corbusier. In her projects she manages to animate the basic objects of everyday life with new aesthetic values: in particular, his talent and intuition in the discovery and use of new materials are to appear in their full extent.\r\nThe feature which characterizes the personality of Charlotte Perriand is an honest commitment to the principles of a human rationalism and innovator, who has preserved in her works, which have been occupied with passion.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
