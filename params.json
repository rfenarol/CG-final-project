She promoted a profound renewal of aesthetic values, and gave birth to a properly modern sensibility of everyday life. In this context, its specific contribution focuses on the spaces of the interior, which are conceived as an engine of a new way of living, which is still at the center of the contemporary lifestyle.\r\n\r\n![Charlotte Perriand](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/2601681.JPG)\r\n\r\nIn the field of the history of the twentieth century, the advent of modernity is made possible by the enterprising boldness of this real reform of the interior. When she was only twenty-four, began a ten-year collaboration with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, at the famous atelier of 35, rue de SÃ¨vres in Paris.\r\nHer presence in the atelier of Le Corbusier is visible in all the furniture designed. Charlotte Perriand becomes a cornerstone of the renovation project promoted by the architect, notably by adding a dimension of humanity to the sometimes cold rationalism Le Corbusier.\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Models of furniture design\r\nIn her projects she manages to animate the basic objects of everyday life with new aesthetic values: in particular, his talent and intuition in the discovery and use of new materials are to appear in their full extent.\r\nThe feature which characterizes the personality of Charlotte Perriand is an honest commitment to the principles of a human rationalism and innovator, who has preserved in her works, which have been occupied with passion.\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Ombra\r\nArmchair with frame in chromed steel or painted black.\r\nPillows are removable, the padding is in polyurethane and polyester wadding.\r\n\r\n![Ombra](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ombra/ombra_gallery01.jpg)\r\n[Ombra](http://www.cassina.com/portal/page/portal/new/webpages/cassina/catalogue/product?p=code:CS_512;is_finder_result:0&lang=it)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe model has been decomposed in 3 parts:\r\n* **Feet**\r\n* **Support**\r\n* **Pillows**\r\n\r\nModelling feet has been the hardest part of the work, because of their angular shape. They've been obtained mixing more than one Bezier surface. Feet and support together form the frame of this armchair. Two black pillows (also obtained by mixing Bezier surfaces) have been placed upon the frame to complete the model.\r\n\r\n![Ombra](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ombra/ombra.png)\r\n[Ombra.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/517%20Ombra.js)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Ventaglio\r\nTable in natural oak or stained black. The plan is composed of fourteen staves, the base has three legs. The particular configuration of the floor and the arrangement of the legs allows a dynamic and flexible use of the table, also by a number of persons greater than a traditional configuration.\r\n\r\n![Ventaglio](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ventaglio/ventaglio_gallery01.jpg)\r\n[Ventaglio](http://www.cassina.com/portal/page/portal/new/webpages/cassina/catalogue/product?p=code:CS_511;is_finder_result:0&lang=it)\r\n\r\nThe model of the table has two parts:\r\n* **Surface**\r\n* **Legs**\r\n\r\nThe surface has been created assembling a central part with two other lateral parts, rotated by a suitable angle. Each of them is an easy composition of cuboids and simplicial complex. The effect of the division into 14 staves is obtained by drawing coloured lines all over the surface. Legs has been created starting from simple Bezier curves.\r\n\r\n![Ventaglio](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ventaglio/ventaglio.png)\r\n[Ventaglio.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/511%20Ventaglio.js)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Petalo\r\n![Petalo](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Petalo/petalo.png)\r\n[Petalo.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/519%20Petalo.js)\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Tokyo Outdoor\r\n![Tokyo Outdoor](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Tokyo Outdoor/tokyo outdoor.png)\r\n[Tokyo Outdoor.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/522%20Tokyo%20Outdoor.js)\r\n***\r\n\r\n@Copyright: All images, information and data are property of \"Cassina SPA\".
