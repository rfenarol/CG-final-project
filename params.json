{"name":"Computer Graphic's Final Project","tagline":"","body":"## Charlotte Perriand \r\n##### Paris, 1903-1999\r\n\r\n\r\nCharlotte Perriand is a full part of the cultural avant-garde of the early decades of the twentieth century. She promoted a profound renewal of aesthetic values, and gave birth to a properly modern sensibility of everyday life. In this context, its specific contribution focuses on the spaces of the interior, which are conceived as an engine of a new way of living, which is still at the center of the contemporary lifestyle.\r\n\r\n![Charlotte Perriand](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/2601681.JPG)\r\n\r\nIn the field of the history of the twentieth century, the advent of modernity is made possible by the enterprising boldness of this real reform of the interior. When she was only twenty-four, began a ten-year collaboration with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, at the famous atelier of 35, rue de SÃ¨vres in Paris.\r\nHer presence in the atelier of Le Corbusier is visible in all the furniture designed. Charlotte Perriand becomes a cornerstone of the renovation project promoted by the architect, notably by adding a dimension of humanity to the sometimes cold rationalism Le Corbusier.\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Models of furniture design\r\nIn her projects she manages to animate the basic objects of everyday life with new aesthetic values: in particular, his talent and intuition in the discovery and use of new materials are to appear in their full extent.\r\nThe feature which characterizes the personality of Charlotte Perriand is an honest commitment to the principles of a human rationalism and innovator, who has preserved in her works, which have been occupied with passion.\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Ventaglio\r\nTable in natural oak or stained black. The plan is composed of fourteen staves, the base has three legs. The particular configuration of the floor and the arrangement of the legs allows a dynamic and flexible use of the table, also by a number of persons greater than a traditional configuration.\r\n\r\n![Ventaglio](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ventaglio/ventaglio_gallery01.jpg)\r\n[Ventaglio](http://www.cassina.com/portal/page/portal/new/webpages/cassina/catalogue/product?p=code:CS_511;is_finder_result:0&lang=it)\r\n\r\nThe model of the table has two parts:\r\n* **Surface**\r\n* **Legs**\r\n\r\nThe surface has been created assembling a central part with two other lateral parts, rotated by a suitable angle. Each of them is an easy composition of cuboids and simplicial complex. The effect of the division into 14 staves is obtained by drawing coloured lines all over the surface. Below there is a prototype of the surface developed using the python module Pyplasm:\r\n\r\n![Ventaglio](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ventaglio/prototipoVentaglio.png)\r\n[Ventaglio.py](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/511%20Ventaglio.py)\r\n\r\nLegs has been created starting from simple Bezier curves. Here is the final model developed using Plasm.js:\r\n\r\n![Ventaglio](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ventaglio/ventaglio.png)\r\n[Ventaglio.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/511%20Ventaglio.js)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Ombra\r\nArmchair with frame in chromed steel or painted black.\r\nPillows are removable, the padding is in polyurethane and polyester wadding.\r\n\r\n![Ombra](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ombra/ombra_gallery01.jpg)\r\n[Ombra](http://www.cassina.com/portal/page/portal/new/webpages/cassina/catalogue/product?p=code:CS_512;is_finder_result:0&lang=it)\r\n\r\nThe model has been decomposed in 3 parts:\r\n* **Legs**\r\n* **Support**\r\n* **Pillows**\r\n\r\nModelling legs has been the hardest part of the work, because of their angular shape. They've been obtained mixing more than one Bezier surface. Legs and support together form the frame of this armchair. Below there is a prototype of the frame developed using the python module Pyplasm:\r\n\r\n![Ombra](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ombra/prototipoOmbra.png)\r\n[Ombra.py](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/517%20Ombra.py)\r\n\r\nTwo black pillows (also obtained by mixing Bezier surfaces) have been placed upon the frame to complete the model. Here is the final model developed using Plasm.js:\r\n\r\n![Ombra](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Ombra/ombra.png)\r\n[Ombra.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/517%20Ombra.js)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Petalo\r\nFrom the passion for the color of Charlotte Perriand comes this system of five small tables. The plans, triangular in shape with rounded corners, are lacquered in the colors: red, gray, yellow, green and blue. The sinuous structure, which seems designed with a single stroke of pen, is in matt black painted metal.\r\n\r\n![Petalo](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Petalo/petalo_gallery01.jpg)\r\n[Petalo](http://www.cassina.com/portal/page/portal/new/webpages/cassina/catalogue/product?p=code:CS_519;is_finder_result:0&lang=it)\r\n\r\nThe model of every small table has two parts:\r\n* **Plan**\r\n* **Legs**\r\n\r\nThis is a first prototype of a single table developed using the python module Pyplasm:\r\n\r\n![Petalo](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Petalo/prototipoPetalo.png)\r\n[Petalo.py](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/519%20Petalo.py)\r\n\r\nThe plan has been modeled as a combination of Bezier surfaces. A difficult part of the work has been to represent legs and junctions between them. As is visible in the prototype, they've been designed starting from simple Bezier curves. So, these has been used to create a cubic hermite surface in order to reach a cylindrical frame turning around the plan and composing legs. Below there is the final model developed using Plasm.js:\r\n\r\n![Petalo](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Petalo/petalo.png)\r\n[Petalo.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/519%20Petalo.js)\r\n\r\nTo obtain the system of five small tables, I've used this easy but powerful \"trick\", available thanks to the functional paradigm of the Plasm languages:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar rotationLeft = R([X,Z])(PI/4);\r\nvar scale = S([X,Y,Z])([0.8,0.8,0.8]);\r\nvar translDown = T([X,Y])([0.2,-0.06]);\r\nvar tranf = COMP([scale,rotationLeft,translDown]);\r\nvar model = STRUCT(REPLICA(5)([model,tranf]));\r\n```\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Tokyo Outdoor\r\n\r\nChaise longue, with backrest consisting of 12 strips curved in teak, beech or bamboo and a curved cradle made by the same essence. Basament is in solid teak or beech or solid bamboo rebuilt.\r\n\r\n![Tokyo Outdoor](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Tokyo Outdoor/tokyo_outdoor_gallery02.jpg)\r\n[Tokyo Outdoor](http://www.cassina.com/portal/page/portal/new/webpages/cassina/catalogue/product?p=code:CS_522;is_finder_result:0&lang=it)\r\n\r\nThe model is structured in two main parts:\r\n* **Frame**\r\n* **Basement**\r\n\r\nThe frame is in turn divided into two sub-components:\r\n* **Cradle**\r\n* **Backrest**\r\n \r\nA prototype of the frame, developed using the python module Pyplasm is visible below:\r\n\r\n![Tokyo Outdoor](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Tokyo Outdoor/prototipoTokyo.png)\r\n[Tokyo Outdoor.py](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/522%20Tokyo%20Outdoor.py)\r\n\r\nThe 12 strips of the backrest is the most interesting part of the model, created starting from a single curved stripe and replicated applying a small rotation and translation to each copy with a solution similar to the one seen previously:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar rotationLeft = R([X,Z])(PI/180);\r\nvar traslationLeft = T([Z])([0.45]);\r\nvar tranfLeft = COMP([rotationLeft,traslationLeft]);\r\nvar backrestLeft = STRUCT(REPLICA(6)([backrest,tranfLeft]));\r\nvar rotationRight = R([X,Z])(-PI/180);\r\nvar traslationRight = T([Z])([-0.45]);\r\nvar tranfRight = COMP([rotationRight,traslationRight]);\r\nvar backrestRight = STRUCT(REPLICA(6)([backrest,tranfRight]));\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach stripe is a combination of Bezier surfaces and semicircular parts. The basement is composed of 4 cylinders representing the legs, joined by some conjunctive parts to give support to the cradle.\r\nThis is the final model developed using Plasm.js:\r\n\r\n![Tokyo Outdoor](http://rfenarol.github.io/CG-final-project/images/Tokyo Outdoor/tokyo outdoor.png)\r\n[Tokyo Outdoor.js](https://raw.github.com/rfenarol/CG-final-project/master/522%20Tokyo%20Outdoor.js)\r\n***\r\n\r\n@Copyright: All images, information and data are property of \"Cassina SPA\".
